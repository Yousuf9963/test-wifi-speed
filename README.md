You must have checked the speed of your internet connection once in your life using platforms like speedtest.net. Have you ever thought about doing the same with Python? Well if you want to learn how to perform an internet speed test using Python then this article is for you. In this article, I will present a tutorial on how to perform an internet speed test using Python.

# Internet Speed Test

When checking the speed of the Internet connection, the results are displayed as download speed and upload speed. Download speed refers to the speed at which your internet connection downloads data from the internet and upload speed refers to the speed at which your internet connection uploads data to the internet. So, calculating the download speed and the upload speed of an Internet connection sums up the Internet speed test.

# Installation

pkg update && pkg upgrade -y
pkg install git
pkg install python3
git clone https://github.com/Yousuf9963/test-wifi-speed.git
cd test-wifi-speed
python3 test-wifi-speed.py
